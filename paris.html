  <p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">M<font size= "4"></b>aria Grazia Chiuri has her mind set on infusing her feminist sensibilities into the feminine house of Christian Dior. On one hand, her mission is lofty; on the other hand, it’s pragmatic and down-to-earth. Yes, women can be both! But let’s be practical: Her distinctly aged-down version of Dior ready-to-wear is not exactly “democratic”—for this is a French luxury house—but it’s ultimately intended to be accessible to millennials.

  <p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">T<font size= "4"></b>he healing power of nature, the need for optimism, the importance of handcraft, the celebratory power of forward-looking fashion: All these things have been constant talking points in Paris for over a week now, but it took Karl Lagerfeld and Chanel to actually bring the vertiginous cliffs and coursing waterfalls of the Gorges du Verdon to the Grand Palais and wrap it all up in a final spectacular word on every point. The scenery—a facsimile of a beauty spot in the South of France—was so naturalistic that a breeze floated along the canyon, blowing off the girls’ clear plastic boaters and setting their extraordinary clothes flowing as they strode on in their thigh-high plastic boots

    <p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">"I<font size= "4"></b>want to tell the story of Saint Laurent, of Paris—nothing more deeply than that,” said Anthony Vaccarello, fielding a huge backstage scene after his epic open-air show on a balmy night, with the Eiffel Tower sparkling in the background. Hundreds of spectators—the public and professionals—looked on, held in the awestruck moment. There were legs for miles and glamour as far as the eye could see. Ostrich feathers flew, glitter dresses glinted, duchesse satin bubbled, and boots upon more boots stomped. Vaccarello summed it up, humbly and succinctly: “That girl of Saint Laurent—she wants to have fun,” he said.

  <p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">V<font size= "4"></b>irgil Abloh is a more of a “designer” than a designer. The part-time DJ has certainly made a lot of noise since sweeping into fashion on Kanye West’s coattails and making his own mark in the luxury streetwear sector with Off-White’s graphic black-and-white diagonal stripes plastered on jean jackets. His catchy branding and orbit of music/fashion/streetwear influencers has minted him collaborations with Nike, Jimmy Choo and Rimowa, and, for a hot second, put his name in the same sentences as Givenchy and Versace when succession has come up.

    <p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">S<font size= "4"></b>ometimes, fashion disarms. It’s part of the wonder, one reason why those of us who love it so much love it so much. Such moments almost never occur when you run backstage for the editorial soundbite, typically about inspiration — this or that museum exhibit; summers with boho grandma; increasing likely these days, political manifesto. Not so at Balmain on Thursday when, before his Balmain show, Olivier Rousteing disarmed with emotional conversation about his childhood, his fame, his place in fashion, the shallow perceptions of him that he wants to shatter. His spring show, he offered, would be a turning point, “a big celebration, a new era.”

  <p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">F<font size= "4"></b>or spring, Ghesquière mixed the modern with the historical, beginning with the venue: The runway was staged inside the medieval wing on the ground floor of the Louvre, lined with exposed bricks that made up the walls of a fortress, which protected the former royal palace from invasions as early as the 12th century. Always a master at taking elements of classical tailoring and giving them a futuristic twist, Ghesquière looked to "18th century French aristocratic garments" as a starting point for the collection, according to the show notes. The doublets, tie-neck silk blouses, ruffled sleeves and rich brocades that were once fit for a king were cut in cropped silhouettes and paired with sporty, striped separates, athletic shorts, metallic pants and — what else? — clunky basketball sneakers.
