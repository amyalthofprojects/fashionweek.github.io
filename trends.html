<p class="trends1"> <font size= "7"> W<font size= "5">e have seen a lot of new trends this year's fashion week, we summed up all our favorites for fall’17
</p>
<p class="trends1"><font size= "7"><b>R<font size= "5">ed</b> <br>Red is totally trending right now, it’s the color of Fall ‘17.
There were sleek coates at Givenchy and statement OTK boots by Fendi soon-to-be seen all over the street style circuit.<br>

<p class="trends1"> <font size= "7"><b>V<font size= "5">intage-inspired Fur</b><br> Last season it was all about the statement fur, but for fall ‘17 we go back to basics. Yeezy, J.W. Anderson and Vetements all featured classic, vintage-inspired coats that looked like they were plucked from a estate sale.

<p class="trends1"> <font size= "7"><b>G<font size= "5">litterati Boots</b><br>Sparkle and shine is the new boot trend. Chanel’s space age go-go pair will take you out of this world, and the Rihanna-worn Saint-Laurent ones will make you feel like a star. Consider this the white boot of fall- aka a must have!

<p class="trends1"> <font size= "7"><b>'70<font size= "5">s Plaid</b><br>This season it’s all about the bright plaid from the ‘70s. The versatile print was crafted into classic coats at Prada, statement pants at Tome, and as a formal gown  at Jenny Packham.

<p class="trends1"> <font size= "7"><b>V<font size= "5">ictorian Collars</b><br>This fall you’ll be neck deep in victorian-inspired collars.
It’s the turtleneck fancy older sister. Brands like Kenzo, John Galliano took literally the shakespearean white, while Frame and Lemaire modernized it into crisp poplin.

<p class="trends1"> <font size= "7"><b>L<font size= "5">eisure Suits</b><br>The latest in cozy war are the leisure suits, but we also like to call it the track suits. It's a far cry from your typical athleisure look, with Chloé's cozy set in suede and Ashish's in technicolor sequins. Wear them with stilettos the way Rihanna styled it for her show for Fenty Puma.
