  <p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">D<font size= "4"></b>ress like you're going to the beach, but make it fashion, was the vibe of Michael Kors' spring 2018 collection presented on Wednesday during New York Fashion Week. According to Glamour, the show notes described the clothing is “all about ease” — and what’s easier than throwing on a pair of flip-flops?

  <p class="dcr"> <b> <font size= "7">T<font size= "4"></b>he show location was in Lauren’s own garage, which is a bit of a misnomer. The space, built alongside a banal strip mall, was no bland storage facility but more of a luxury spa for exotic cars. These are Lauren’s passion: Ferrari, McLaren, Porsche, Bugatti. Even if auto technology gives you no thrill, it’s impossible not to be impressed by the elegant lines of the Bugatti, its perfect symmetry and sexy curves.
The models came sauntering out in Glen plaid and checks. Slim skirts, tailored jackets and crisp trousers. Then came the black leather and the race car references. But the glossy red coat and gowns were not aerodynamic and sleek; they were luxurious and elegant.

<p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">C<font size= "4"></b>hasing cool is exhausting. Chasing it to Bushwick on Saturday night for Alexander Wang’s spring show was a fool’s errand. When Wang pulled up in a party bus on a dead-end street an hour late at 10:30 p.m. and did his signature sprint down the runway after, his high-energy glow was in stark contrast to the low that had dispersed through the crowd over the course of the hour spent being corralled behind metal police barricades waiting for #Wangfest to begin.

His spring collection was stocked with great options for special-occasion dressing: long dresses, short dresses, statement tops and great slim pants, blouses and skirts, and a few separates that could pass for daywear but would be dressed-up by most standards. He used the fun fabulosity of the late Seventies/early Eighties as his reference — Mick and Bianca Jagger were name-checked in show notes — working with polka dots, star prints, sculpted ruffles and lace modernizing the throwback effervescence in a look that felt very now.

<p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">G<font size= "4"></b>enuine provocation — there’s not enough of it in fashion. Raf Simons is determined to show us what we’ve been missing. He arrived at 205 West 39th Street, Calvin Klein’s longtime address and recently renamed, at his behest, Collection label, determined to tackle large questions of cultural resonance via the fashion genre. After two collections, it’s clear that Simons’ approach is to mine broad-stroke aspects of American culture, whether out of respect, curiosity or a yen to telegraph to skeptics (if any exist), his appropriateness for the creative helm of one of the great bastions of American fashion.

<p class="dcr"> <b><font size= "7">I<font size= "4"></b>t’s too bad that Marc Jacobs closes New York Fashion Week. His show yesterday at the Park Avenue Armory wasn’t necessarily the best on the spring 2018 bill, but it was the most moving. After nine sprawling days of shows, from Bushwick to Bedford, you were too demented to appreciate the utter beauty of it.
